## Monday
The company's business involves producing lighting products for customers. It starts with design and then goes into manufacturing. Zoro narrowed the focus to manufacturing and delivery. Zoro initiated by discussing with the IT manager, mapping out the entire business process from customer orders to shipments. The business was divided into several modules, followed by a detailed analysis of each sub-module.
